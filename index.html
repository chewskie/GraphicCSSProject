<div class="containerbodyparagraph1 grad1">
  <p>This past Spring the National Center for Health Statistics reported that in 2020 3.6 million babies were born in the United States. The year before, 3.75 million babies were born, indicating a 4% drop in birth rate. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the number of births has declined, down an average of 2% per year. Last year’s double drop signals that the pandemic specifically is causing some American women to either delay pregnancy or not have children at all.</p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph2 grad2">
  <p>This shift is reflected worldwide. According to the UN World Population Prospects statistics, the current birth rate globally in 2021 is 17.873 births per 1000 people, a 1.13% decline from 2020, which respectively saw a 1.12 % decline from 2019. The global fertility rate declined from 3.2 live births per woman in 1990 to 2.5 in 2019. A 2020 report done by the UN predicts that fertility is expected to continue declining. The global level of fertility is expected to reach 2.2 live births per woman in 2050 and 1.9 in 2100. </p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph3 grad3">
  <p>There is a positive correlation between declining birth rate and access to contraception. Globally, in 2019, 49% of all women in the reproductive age range (15-49 years) were using some form of contraception, an increase from 42% in 1990.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph4 grad4">
  <p>The data further demonstrates that 50% of the population lives in a country or area where lifetime fertility is below 2.1 live births per woman, which is estimated to be the level required for populations with low mortality to have a growth rate of zero long term. </p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph5 grad5">
  <p>All this data shows that more women are choosing, or are increasingly able to choose, when and if they want to have kids. However, the UN statistics do not illustrate why exactly people are choosing to have fewer children, or to have none at all. </p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph6 grad6">
  <p>A 2018 study done by the New York Times asked young adults in the US to list the factors that influenced them to have, or to plan on having, less children than they considered ideal. The most common listed influential factor was that childcare is too expensive (64% of the 1858 people interviewed). </p>
</div>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph7 grad7">
  <p>Descending listed factors by order of popularity included wanting to have more time for the children they already had (54%), worry about the economy (49%), inability to afford more children (44%)...</p>

<div class="containerbodyparagraph9">
  <p>...Other answers included worry about global instability (37%), worry about climate change (33%), worry about population growth (27%), prioritization of education and career (23%), and the belief that they would be an unfit parent (13%).</p>
